## [Modeling heterogeneous direct and third-country effects of the trade policy network]
(with Dr. Octavio Fernández-Amador) 
This paper presents a structural Melitz-type gravity model with firm heterogeneity featuring heterogeneous trade cost elasticities to estimate modular 
effects of trade agreements. We provide a structural underpinning for heterogeneous third-country—trade diversion and reverse diversion—effects.
The correct estimation strategy when using approximated multilateral resistances in panels is shown. We analyze the components of the indirect effects of agreements,
and two simulations highlight the quantitative importance of indirect effects. Third-country effects from the network of agreements in place can be economically
significant. Governments should consider third-country effects when analyzing potential strategic integration scenarios.

## [Patterns of regulatory differences in international trade: intensity coverage and structure]
(with Achim Vogt ) 
With falling tariffs the role of regulatory heterogeneity in international trade has become center in recent debates on regional integration and trade costs.
However, few studies explicitly take into account the specific nature of the underlying regulatory differences. Thus, we propose distinguishing regulatory 
heterogeneity with respect to the intensity, coverage, and structure of regulations, and present indicators reflecting each one of these dimensions.
Enabled by detailed product-level regulatory data based on coded reviews of national legislation, we illustrate the different channels of regulatory heterogeneity
on the country- and sector-level. We construct well-established descriptive indicators and more recently developed measures of regulatory distance to identify patterns
of non-tariff measures via principal component analysis, clustering techniques and association analysis. The findings motivate separate treatment of the different
heterogeneity dimensions in  the assessment of non-tariff measures in international trade. Outputs of the analysis are transferred to a database available at 
different sectoral aggregations that can be used for example in gravity-type analysis.

## [Global value chains as determinants of non-tariff measures]
(with Achim Vogt) 
The organization of modern production into complex, cross-border networks raises the question of whether countries’ value chain linkages determine their trade-related
policies. In this paper, we show that increases in domestic value added into foreign final goods leads to decreases in regulatory stringency measured as tariffs but
also as technical nontariff measures. Trade-network structures incentivize regulatory harmonization to avoid harming domestic producers.

## [PTA determinants: The effect of regulatory differences in international trade]
(with Joseph Francois, Achim Vogt, & Selina Hauser)
Regulatory heterogeneity is perceived as the most important trade barrier today. In this paper we analyze how regulatory distance regarding non-tariff measures is a
determinant to sign a preferential trade agreement (PTA) and its level of depth integration (shallow, middle, or deep) regarding the number of provisions included. 
We find that higher regulatory heterogeneity among a country pair increases the likelihood of singing shallow, middle, or deep preferential trade agreements to
overcome the different regulatory systems. However, the opposite effect is found for deeper ones as higher levels of harmonization are harder to achieve when both
countries depart from different regulatory systems.

## [Quantifying the costs of European disintegration]
(with Joseph Francois & Octavio Fernández Amador)
The past fifty years have witnessed an upsurge in trade integration which has crystallized in the multiplication in the number of economic integration agreements. 
However, in the last decade fears of de-globalization and disintegration of current international structures have spurred across the world and particularly impacted 
the European Union after Brexit. Nowadays, trade agreements go beyond tariff reductions and include also non-tariff and trade facilitation measures. In this context,
proper quantification exercises of the consequences that a possible European disintegration would have are of utmost importance. We propose departing from a structural
gravity model to estimate the effects of trade agreements in Europe to include the negative values of these estimated shocks into a general equilibrium model consistent
with firm heterogeneity à la Melitz to analyse the effects of disintegration on all European and third-countries regarding trade and welfare measures.
