## [Patterns of regulatory differences in international trade: intensity coverage and structure]
With falling tariffs the role of regulatory heterogeneity in international trade has become center in recent debates on regional integration and trade costs. However, few studies explicitly take into account the specific nature of the underlying regulatory differences. Thus, we propose distinguishing regulatory heterogeneity with respect to the intensity, coverage, and structure of regulations, and present indicators reflecting each one of these dimensions. Enabled by detailed product-level regulatory data based on coded reviews of national legislation, we illustrate the different channels of regulatory heterogeneity on the country- and sector-level. We construct well-established descriptive indicators and more recently developed measures of regulatory distance to identify patterns of non-tariff measures via principal component analysis, clustering techniques and association analysis. The findings motivate separate treatment of the different heterogeneity dimensions in  the assessment of non-tariff measures in international trade. Outputs of the analysis are transferred to a database available at different sectoral aggregations that can be used for example in gravity-type analysis.

## [Global value chains as determinants of non-tariff measures]
The organization of modern production into complex, cross-border networks raises the question of whether countries’ value chain linkages determine their trade-related policies. In this paper, we show that increases in domestic value added into foreign final goods leads to decreases in regulatory stringency measured as tariffs but also as technical nontariff measures. Trade-network structures incentivize regulatory harmonization to avoid harming domestic producers

## [Modeling heterogeneous direct and third-country effects of the trade policy network]
This paper presents a structural Melitz-type gravity model with firm heterogeneity featuring heterogeneous trade cost elasticities to estimate modular effects of trade agreements. We provide a structural underpinning for heterogeneous third-country—trade diversion and reverse diversion—effects. The correct estimation strategy when using approximated multilateral resistances in panels is shown. We analyze the components of the indirect effects of agreements, and two simulations highlight the quantitative importance of indirect effects. Third-country effects from the network of agreements in place can be economically significant. Governments should consider third-country effects when analyzing potential strategic integration scenarios.
