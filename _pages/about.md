I am a postdoctoral researcher in economics at the Centre for Agro-Food Research and Technology (CITA). 

Awarded a Doctorate in Economics with the highest honors, summa cum laude, from the University of Bern (May 2024). My research focuses on the diverse impacts of trade agreements and specific trade policy tools, particularly non-tariff measures.

In my Job Market Paper, we derive from a theoretical Melitz-type model with firm heterogeneity featuring heterogeneous trade cost elasticities a structural gravity model to estimate modular effects of trade agreements. We provide a structural underpinning for heterogeneous third-country—trade diversion and reverse diversion—effects. Third-country effects from the network of agreements in place can be economically significant and governments should consider them when analyzing potential strategic integration scenarios.
