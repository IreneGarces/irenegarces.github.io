I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the World Trade Institute and am on the 2022/2023 Job Market.

My research interest are focused around International trade and applied econometrics.

I am interested in understanding the heterogeneous effects of trade agreements and particular trade policy instruments such as non-tariff measures.

In my Job Market Paper, we derived from a theoretical Melitz-type model with firm heterogeneity featuring heterogeneous trade cost elasticities a structural gravity model to estimate modular effects of trade agreements. We provide a structural underpinning for heterogeneous third-country—trade diversion and reverse diversion—effects. Third-country effects from the network of agreements in place can be economically significant and governments should consider them when analyzing potential strategic integration scenarios.
