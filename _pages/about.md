I am a postdoctoral researcher in economics at the Centre for Agro-Food Research and Technology (CITA) under an EU-funded project [Brightspace](https://brightspace-project.eu/). Awarded a Doctorate in Economics with the highest honors, summa cum laude, from the University of Bern (May 2024). 

Broadly, my research focuses on the heterogeneous impacts of trade agreements and specific trade policy tools, particularly non-tariff measures.

Specifically, I am interested in how international trade plays a role in a globalised world. How do trade agreements affect members and third-countryâ€”trade diversion and reverse diversion effects? How are the gains and losses distributed according to the level of development and sectoral variability? What is the role of global value chains and non-tariff measures in shaping the international sphere?
